.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool allows users to monitor logs in real-time, with options for filtering and coloring the output for easy readability. It can read from files, a named pipe, or stdin. When reading from a pipe, it runs in server mode, logging data to an internal ringbuffer and serving it to rog clients which print it to console just like tailing a file.

The following options are available:

.SH Server Mode Flags
.TP 8
\fB-f FIFO\_PATH\fP
Creates and reads from a named pipe at the specified path. This option implies
\fB-s\fP (server mode).
.TP
\fB-t FILE_PATH\fP
Similar to -f, but reads from a file. Not sure why you would use this flag but ok.
.TP
\fB-s\fP
Operates in server mode, which defaults to reading from standard input.

.SH Client or Tail Mode Flags
.TP 8
\fB-i IP\fP
Specifies the IP address of the server when operating in client mode. By default, it uses localhost
(127.0.0.1).
.TP
\fB-l NUM\fP
Specifies the number of bytes to read from the server before exiting. By default, it reads
indefinitely.
.TP
\fB-o NUM\fP
Limits the number of bytes per row in the output. By default, there is no limit.
.TP
\fB-r F1,F2,F3...\fP
Removes fields from the output. Matches log fields with format field=value or field="quoted value". Multiple fields can be specified separated by commas.
.TP
\fB-g REGEX\fP
Only shows lines that match the specified regular expression pattern.
.TP
\fB-w REGEX\fP
Like \fB-g\fP, but only matches whole words.
.TP
\fB-v REGEX\fP
Only shows lines that do not match the specified regular expression pattern.
.TP
\fB-m THEME\fP
Changes the color scheme of the output. Available themes are: Visual Studio Dark+, 1337, DarkNeon, Dracula,
Coldark-Dark, Monokai Extended, Sublime Snazzy, TwoDark, base16, gruvbox-dark, Nord, zenburn, ansi.
.TP
\fB-C NUM\fP
Shows NUM lines of context around grep results. Note that these flags only include context from the same 'read' operation.
.TP
\fB-A NUM\fP
Shows NUM lines of context after grep results.
.TP
\fB-B NUM\fP
Shows NUM lines of context before grep results.
.TP
\fB-b\fP
Puts file names in a line break between chunks rather than on the side.
.TP
\fB-u\fP
Truncates bytes that don't fit the terminal.
.TP
\fB-c\fP
Disables syntax highlighting.
.TP
\fB-n\fP
Use the same colors for all files.

.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of how to use the tool:

Create a named pipe at /tmp/myfifo and read from it in server mode:
.RS
.PP
\fBrog -f /tmp/myfifo\fP
.RE

Read the stdout of some_program in server mode:
.RS
.PP
\fBsome_program | rog -s\fP
.RE

Connect to a rog server running on localhost and print whatever it is
serving:
.RS
.PP
\fBrog\fP
.RE

Connect to a rog server running on 10.0.0.4 and print whatever it is serving, removing
the 'time' and 'date' fields if they are present:
.RS
.PP
\fBrog -i 10.0.0.4 -r time,date\fP
.RE

Monitor some log files and only show lines that start with ERROR, with 3 lines of
context:
.RS
.PP
\fBrog *.log -g "^ERROR" -C3\fP
.RE
